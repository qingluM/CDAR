Step1: run the code "model_define.py" to obtain pre-trained source model. You can choose different tasks to generate corresponding pre-trained models, and models can be found in "pre-trained model". Additionally, models used in this paper is also provided in "pre-trained model/model used in this paper". 

Step2: run the code "Target.py" to get results on target domain of four methods, including Model1 ,Model2 ,FA and CDAR. Ramdom seed used in this paper can also be provided in "SeedRecord". You can choose different tasks to generate corresponding results, which can be found in folder "Results".

Remark:
Code "Loss_evalute" is used to calculate loss.
Code "conditional_kernel" is used to calculate the CEOD.
