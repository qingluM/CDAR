Step1: run the code "model_define.py" to obtain pre-trained source model.
Step2: run the code "Target.py" to get results on target domain of four methods, including Model1 ,Model2 ,FA and CDAR.

Remark:
Code "Loss_evalute" is used to calculate loss.
Code "conditional_kernel" is used to calculate the CEOD.
